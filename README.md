Original source code is located in this repo location:

/data/amos/leg31.Asc



NOTE: currently only 64 bit versions of Linux and Windows are supported, 32 bit versions can be added by modyfing Legion.csproj file to recognize bitness and choose 32bit versions of SDL.dll (they are already available in theirs folders under lib directory). OSX should be also supported but it was not tested.
